// Teensy port: Stockfish's history tables need tens of megabytes (the
// continuation history alone is 8 MB). Here they are scaled to fit in a few
// tens of kilobytes:
//   - butterfly history indexed by from/to (12 bits) instead of the raw move
//   - capture history unchanged (16 KB)
//   - continuation, pawn and low-ply histories replaced by the classic killer
//     moves and counter move heuristics used by earlier Stockfish versions
//   - correction history keeps the pawn and minor-piece tables, 4096 entries each
